        <h2>Cyclones</h2>
        <p>A cyclone is a large-scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure. Cyclones are characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and often cause extensive damage, especially along coastal regions. They form over warm ocean waters and can bring about destructive winds, storm surges, and flooding. Cyclones are classified by their intensity, which may range from tropical depressions to severe tropical cyclones, with the potential to cause significant destruction to life, property, and the environment.</p>
